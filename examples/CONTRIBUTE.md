# contribute

We need to create new components for other framekworks. This document
describes the stuff to get a full featured repository.

Licence is MIT.

## Basic stuff

The repository contains the source code for a component to use the Lyra
embedded payment form.

The repository should allow to:

- easily develop the component
- allow to run, build and test using docker and docker-compose
- tests should run on travis automatically
- a CHANGELOG.md

You should add widely used badges:

- test coverage
- build pass (with tests, from travis)
- licence badge

## component configuration

There is 3 configuration levels you should provide and test

### setup parameters

TODO

### template parameters

TODO

### runtime parameters

TODO

## Exmaples

Write the following examples:

- minimal: a basic example using cli basic default boilerplate
- pre_loaded: a button that display the form as quick a possible

Each example should be documented and tested.
