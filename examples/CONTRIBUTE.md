# Contribute

We need to create new components for other framekworks. This document
describes the stuff to get a full featured repository.

Licence is MIT.

## Basic stuff

The repository contains the source code for a component to use the Lyra
embedded payment form.

The repository should allow to:

- Easily develop the component
- Allow to run, build and unitary test the plugin/extension
- Tests should run on travis automatically on every commit
- A CHANGELOG.md

You should add widely used badges:

- Build pass (with tests, from travis)
- Licence badge

## Component configuration

There are 3 configuration levels you should provide and test.
See vue.js readme file sections:

- setup parameters
- template parameters

## Examples

Write the following examples:

- minimal: a basic example using cli basic default boilerplate
- pre_loaded: a button that display the form as quick a possible

Each example should be documented and tested.
